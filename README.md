# Neural Network Hyperparameter Optimization using RMSProp Algorithm and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (Sequential Model-Based Optimization) 

The goal of this repository is to share an easy-to-handle class for Hyperparameter optimization, using the RMSProp algorithm. Behind the scenes, this class uses neupy, hyperopt and scikit-learn packages. 

## Example
